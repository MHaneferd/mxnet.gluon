# mxnet.gluon
Some Python scripts that I have modified and extended to learn the Mxnet gluon package for deep learning, and Python coding itself..


[gluon-a2c.py](https://github.com/MHaneferd/mxnet.gluon/blob/master/gluon-a2c-ascii-env/gluon-a2c.py)
This file have a simple synchronized actor critic model (A2C) which train on a ascii environment with a target and a player that shoots. You can easily modify number of shots for each episode. And also the number of episodes. The environment size is also customizable.
